            Hello, my name is Sophia Bennett. I am an Interior Architect passionate about designing spaces that are both functional and inspiring. With a strong foundation in architectural principles and a keen eye for aesthetics, I specialize in creating environments that elevate everyday living while reflecting the unique identity and needs of each client.
            <br>
            <br>
            I hold a Bachelor's degree in Interior Architecture, during which I developed a deep understanding of spatial planning, material selection, and human-centered design. Early in my career, I had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects — from boutique residential spaces to large-scale commercial developments — allowing me to build versatile experience across different sectors and project scopes.
            <br>
            <br>
            My core expertise includes concept development, space optimization, project visualization, and detailed technical drawings. I am skilled in using industry-standard design tools such as AutoCAD, SketchUp, and Adobe Creative Suite, and I prioritize functionality, sustainability, and timeless design in every project I undertake. I am committed to delivering cohesive, well-balanced spaces that enhance both visual appeal and user experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout my career, I have worked closely with clients, contractors, and multidisciplinary teams, ensuring that every phase of the design process — from initial concept to final implementation — runs smoothly and successfully. I am particularly passionate about integrating sustainable materials, innovative solutions, and thoughtful lighting design to create environments that are both beautiful and responsible.
            <br>
            <br>
            I believe that continuous learning and adaptability are crucial in the ever-evolving design world. I regularly attend design expos, workshops, and seminars to stay updated on the latest trends, materials, and technologies. I am also deeply interested in the psychology of space and how thoughtful design can positively impact mood, behavior, and well-being.
